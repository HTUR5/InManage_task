# InManage_task
Hodaya Turgeman <br>
My first PHP project <br>

for running the project I used XAMPP: <br>
1. install XAMPP <br>
2. save this folder on the XAMPP defult folder (you see in the installation) <br>
3. enter the details in config.php (from http://localhost/phpmyadmin) <br>
3. run in the browser: localhost\init_database.php for making the tables and download the icon <br>
4. run in the browser: localhost\index.php...done! <br>

<h1>notes: </h1><br>
q1 is in admin_func.php <br>
q3 is in init_database.php <br>
q4 is in upload_image.php <br>
q5 is the posts you see in index.php, the relevant function is getByActiveUser() in Post class <br>
q6 is the getByBirthday() function in Post class <br>
q7 is in statistics.php <br>


<h1>for future work: </h1><br>
I would like to do the user side as well. In this project I only referred to the admin's interface.<br>
In addition, I would like to add features to a more convenient interface for the admin and the user. <br>
